Pyhughml - The next generation hughml parser and emitter for Python.

To install, type 'python setup.py install'.

By default, the setup.py script checks whether Libhughml is installed
and if so, builds and installs Libhughml bindings.  To skip the check
and force installation of Libhughml bindings, use the option '--with-libhughml':
'python setup.py --with-libhughml install'.  To disable the check and
skip building and installing Libhughml bindings, use '--without-libhughml':
'python setup.py --without-libhughml install'.

When Libhughml bindings are installed, you may use fast Libhughml-based
parser and emitter as follows:

    >>> hughml.load(stream, Loader=hughml.CLoader)
    >>> hughml.dump(data, Dumper=hughml.CDumper)

Pyhughml includes a comprehensive test suite.  To run the tests,
type 'python setup.py test'.
